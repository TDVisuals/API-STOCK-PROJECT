![IMG_2211](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bff97fbc-964c-4e87-8961-e003bf0be943)


For this project I picked the following 5 stocks:
- Tesla
- Nike
- Google
- Mara
- AMD
For each stock I collected historical data for four periods: 1 month, 6 months, 2 years, and 5 years, and used that data to calculate key stats like the mean, median, and mode of the closing prices. Finally, I created line plots using the 5 year data to visualize how each stock and grown (or declined) overtime.
