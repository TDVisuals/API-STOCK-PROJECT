For each stock I collected historical data from all 5 of the stocks showed above! I did this for four periods: 1 month, 6 months, 2 years, and 5 years, and used that data to calculate key stats like the mean, median, and mode of the closing prices. Finally, I created line plots using the 5 year data to visualize how each stock and grown (or declined) overtime.
